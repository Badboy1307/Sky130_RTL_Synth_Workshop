# Sky130 RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop

VSD Sky130 RTL was a five day workshop where I have learnt about the open source tools used in the VLSI Industry, timing liberties, hierarchical and flat synthesis concepts, optimization in both sequencial logic and combinational logic circuitry codes, GLS Blocking and non blocking statements and finally I have learnt about the optimization techniques used during synthesis of both logic and combinational logic circuitry codes . I will be briefly explaining about these topics daywise and I'll be cataloging my sail of these 5 days workshop.
